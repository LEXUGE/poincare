  abstract = {This treatment of differential geometry and the mathematics required for general relativity makes the subject of this book accessible for the first time to anyone familiar with elementary calculus in one variable and with a knowledge of some vector algebra. The emphasis throughout is on the geometry of the mathematics, which is greatly enhanced by the many illustrations presenting figures of three and more dimensions as closely as book form will allow. The imaginative text is a major contribution to expounding the subject of differential geometry as applied to studies in relativity, and will prove of interest to a large number of mathematicians and physicists.
