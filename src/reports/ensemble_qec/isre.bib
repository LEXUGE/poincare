	abstract = {Dynamics of the two-spin spin-boson model in the presence of Ohmic and sub-Ohmic baths is investigated by employing a multitude of the Davydov D1 trial states, also known as the multi-D1 Ansatz. Its accuracy in dynamics simulations of the two-spin {SBM} is improved significantly over the single D1 Ansatz, especially in the weak to moderately strong coupling regime. Validity of the multi-D1 Ansatz for various coupling strengths is also systematically examined by making use of the deviation vector which quantifies how faithfully the trial state obeys the Schrödinger equation. The time evolution of population difference and entanglement has been studied for various initial conditions and coupling strengths. Careful comparisons are carried out between our approach and three other methods, i.e., the time-dependent numerical renormalization group ({TD}-{NRG}) approach, the Bloch-Redfield theory, and a method based on a variational master equation. For strong coupling, the multi-D1 trial state yields consistent results as the {TD}-{NRG} approach in the Ohmic regime while the two disagree in the sub-Ohmic regime, where the multi-D1 trial state is shown to be more accurate. For weak coupling, the multi-D1 trial state agrees with the two master-equation methods in the presence of both Ohmic and sub-Ohmic baths, but shows considerable differences with the {TD}-{NRG} approach in the presence of a sub-Ohmic bath, calling into question the validity of the {TD}-{NRG} results at long times in the literature.},

              Incorporating protection against quantum errors into adiabatic quantum computing ({AQC}) is an important task due to the inevitable presence of decoherence. Here, we investigate an error-protected encoding of the {AQC} Hamiltonian, where qubit ensembles are used in place of qubits. Our Hamiltonian only involves total spin operators of the ensembles, offering a simpler route towards error-corrected quantum computing. Our scheme is particularly suited to neutral atomic gases where it is possible to realize large ensemble sizes and produce ensemble-ensemble entanglement. We identify a critical ensemble size
              N
              c
              where the nature of the first excited state becomes a single particle perturbation of the ground state, and the gap energy is predictable by mean-field theory. For ensemble sizes larger than
              N
              c
              , the ground state becomes protected due to the presence of logically equivalent states and the {AQC} performance improves with
              N
              , as long as the decoherence rate is sufficiently low.},
